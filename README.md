Time Zone Field
======================

Time Zone Field (tzfield) provides an autocomplete or select field for storing
time zones. It could be useful if, for example, you have a node type
representing a location such as city, office, station, etc., and you wish to
associate a time zone with these nodes. Time zone data is stored in the standard
[tz database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database) format, e.g.
`Europe/London`.
